# Handy Algorithms

Here, you'll find a collection of algorithms that were written as exercises between 2013 and 2014 in various programming languages, including Python 2.x, C++, and C. These algorithms cover a range of topics and can be a valuable resource for learning and reference.

## Python 2.x

### Aho-Corasick
The Aho-Corasick algorithm is used for string matching and is particularly efficient when searching for multiple patterns in a given text simultaneously.

### Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements into buckets based on their individual digits or significant places.

### Counting Sort
Counting Sort is a stable, non-comparative sorting algorithm that works well when the range of input values is known and relatively small.

### Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sort a list of elements.

### Infix to Postfix
This algorithm converts an infix expression to a postfix expression, which can be useful in various computational tasks.

### Infix to Prefix
Similar to the previous algorithm, this one converts an infix expression to a prefix expression.

### Tower of Hanoi (Recursive)
The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic example of recursion. This algorithm solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a recursive approach.

### Tower of Hanoi (Non-recursive)
In contrast to the recursive solution, this algorithm solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using an iterative approach, which can be helpful for understanding the difference between recursive and iterative problem-solving.

## C++

### Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its stable and efficient performance. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort a list of elements.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

### Inversion Sort
Inversion Sort, also known as Counting Inversions, is an algorithm used to count the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

## C

### Infix Expression Evaluation
This algorithm evaluates an infix expression and computes the result. It demonstrates how to handle arithmetic expressions with parentheses, operators, and operands.
